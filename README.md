# React Glossary
Below are terms and concepts helpful to understanding React. I have listed the terms without the definitions to give you the opportunity to write your own. The act of clarifying your knowledge through writing is important for solidifying your understanding and uncovering areas of confusion.

The terms in bold are the ones I think are essential for you to be able to define.

Once you've written your own, compare it to my definitions in the definitions file. Enjoy!
